        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Passionate developer with experience in various technologies...</p>
        <br>
        <p>Coding has been a strong trait of mine for longer than I have given it credit for.  Throughout high school I took programming and networking classes that ignited the passion for code in my brain.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Outside of high school; during the same time of me learning through these classes, I developed minecraft servers, including websites for each, not only for myself but as a trusted developer for my friends who wanted to run servers as well.  In doing this, not only did it require of me to design websites but I had also learned plenty from working within Java Plugins and their codebase.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now, I study with a passion to learn more of what can be typed into existance with the power of code:  on Codecademy.  Codecademy gave me my outlet for learning; it allowed me to finally realize a chance to take advantage of my burning passion for computers and code; over time, I will become a very well-rounded developer with a love of learning and all that I need to know to create many different types of software, not only websites.</p>
